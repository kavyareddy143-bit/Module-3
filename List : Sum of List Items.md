# List Operations in Python: Sum of List Items

## 🎯 Aim
To write a Python program that calculates the **sum of all elements** in a list.

## 🧠 Algorithm
1. Define a list of numbers.
2. Use Python’s built-in `sum()` function to calculate the total.
3. Print the result.

## 🧾 Program
items=[1,2,-8]

s=0

for i in items:

    s+=i
    
print(s)

## Output
<img width="334" height="187" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/25a7462d-f84c-4688-9816-07be79d23a23" />

## Result
Thus the program that calculates the sum of all elements in a list has been executed successfully.
